## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the r-axis slider and observe the movement of the r-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the y-axis slider and observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z-axis slider and observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## Y-Axis Base :
       The term "Y-Axis Base" in the context of a polar 3D printer is not a standard or widely recognized term. Typically, 3D printers operate using Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, and Z axes), where the print head moves along the X, Y, and Z axes to create the desired object.
## Z-Axis Frame :
       In a polar 3D printer, the "Z-Axis Frame" refers to the structure or framework that supports the vertical movement of the print head or nozzle. The Z-axis is responsible for controlling the height or depth of the printing process.
## Smooth Rods :
       Smooth rods typically refer to the cylindrical rods that provide support and guide the movement of various components, such as the print head or the platform. These smooth rods ensure smooth and precise motion along the designated axes.
## Motors :
       Motors are used to drive the movement of various components, such as the print head or the platform, along the designated axes. These motors provide the necessary torque and rotation to enable the desired circular or rotational motion.
## Extruder Supporter :
       In a polar 3D printer, the "extruder supporter" refers to the component that holds and supports the extruder assembly. The extruder is responsible for feeding and extruding the filament material used for 3D printing.
## Threaded Rod :
       A threaded rod is a type of linear motion component that is used for precise vertical movement along the Z-axis. It is often employed to control the height or depth of the print head or platform in a circular or rotational manner.
## Y-Axis Frame :
       Y-Axis Frame refers to the structure or framework that supports the movement along the Y-axis. The Y-axis frame in a polar printer is responsible for enabling the circular or rotational motion of the print head or platform.
## Motor with Gear :
       A motor with gear refers to a motor that is equipped with a gear mechanism. This combination is often used to drive and control the movement of various components, such as the print head or the platform, in a polar 3D printer.
## Motor-with-Pulley :
       A motor with pulley refers to a motor that is coupled with a pulley mechanism. This configuration is commonly used to provide rotational motion and control in a polar printer.
## Gears :
       Gears can be used to transfer and control motion between different components, allowing for precise movement and positioning. Gears provide a mechanical advantage by altering the speed, torque, and direction of rotation.
## Plate :
       In a polar 3D printer, a "plate" can refer to the platform or bed on which the printed object is built. The plate provides a stable surface for the printing process and supports the initial layers of the printed object.
## Extruder :
       The extruder is the component responsible for feeding and extruding the filament material used for 3D printing. It is an essential part of the printer's system that controls the deposition of material to create the printed object.
## Filament :
       Filament refers to the material used as the raw feedstock for 3D printing. Filament is a long, thin thread-like material that is fed into the extruder and melted for deposition layer by layer to create the 3D printed object.
